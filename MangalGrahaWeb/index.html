            <p>Shri Mangal Dev Temple of Amalner is one of the most ancient, most rare and most ‘live’ (a temple where people experience fulfillment of wishes and desires) of temples in entire India.</p>
            <p>It is public knowledge that temples of Shri Mangal Dev are very rare. Who constructed the Mangal Dev Grah (planet) temple in Amalner and when was the idol established? There is no authentic information regarding this. Some believe that the temple was renovated for the first time in 1933. After 1940 the temple once again went into oblivion and reached a stage of dilapidation. Till 1999 the surroundings of the temple were used as a dumping ground for the town’s waste. It was also a hideout for criminals and other anti-social activities. This fact seems unbelievable but is unfortunately true.</p>
            <p>The post 1999 renovation has brought about a miraculously pleasant transformation in the temple and its surroundings. In the last 5 to 7 years the pace of development of the place and facilities has increased manifold.</p>

    <p>Havan or Yajna holds immense significance in Hindu culture from time immemorial. It is a ritual of energy attainment and purification. The worship of Shri Mangal Dev is conducted in the Havan Kund through the medium of fire. Invocations are made with powerful mantras, and offerings of Yajna Samidha and Havan materials are made. Havanatmak Puja/Shanti of Shri Mangal Dev is performed for the eradication of troubles, sorrows, difficulties, or any lingering questions in one's life, as well as for general well-being.<br>
        The Havanatmak Shanti Puja includes recitations from the Vedas, worship of Ganesha, Matruka Puja, worship of Shri Mangala, worship of the Navagraha Mandal, Rudrakalash Puja, and the actual Havan. <br>

    <h3>Abhishek in the Absence of Devotees</h3>
</div>
<div class="card-body">
    <p>Due to reasons such as age, illness, employment, or business engagements, some devotees may be unable to come to the temple for the abhishek. <br>
        For such individuals, abhishek can be performed at the temple even if they are not physically present. <br>
        Devotees who cannot come to the temple for abhishek can prepare a list of their names at their convenience every fortnight. On Mangalvar (Tuesday), they can independently resolve through Gurujee to perform abhishek in their absence. This includes mentioning the individual's gotra (lineage) and personal details. The entire ritual takes about 1 hour and is performed according to the prescribed procedures. After the abhishek, prasad is sent to the devotees by post. They also receive a certificate of abhishek. Devotees need to deposit the required fee in the organization's bank account in advance or make the payment in person in front of the temple. <br>
        If there are specific requests beyond this, abhishek can also be conducted via video calling. However, devotees need to inform the temple administration in advance for such arrangements. <br>

    <h3>Independent (Special) Abhishek</h3>
</div>
<div class="card-body">
    <p>Throughout the year, on every Tuesday, there is an Abhishek at Shri Mangal Dev Grah Mandir. There is no cessation of Abhishek on any Tuesday. On Tuesdays, a large number of devotees gather to perform Abhishek, coming from all over India. To accommodate such devotees without any inconvenience, the temple administration organizes a collective Abhishek systematically and efficiently. Devotees participating in the Abhishek need to follow the instructions provided by Gurujis (spiritual leaders) and undergo the collective Abhishek. <br>
    For those devotees who do not wish to participate in the collective Abhishek, they can opt for an Independent Abhishek as per their preference. The Independent Abhishek is arranged separately for devotees, where one Gurujis conducts the Abhishek for a single devotee at a time. Detailed information about the pooja is provided to the devotee during the Independent Abhishek, including comprehensive details about the worship. Along with the person undergoing the Abhishek, family members can also sit in the front. For this, it is necessary to deposit the required donation in the organization's bank account or submit it directly at the temple. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red;">Day:</span> Tuesday <br>
    Time: Approximately 2.5 hours <br>

    <h3>Bhomayag</h3>

<div class="card-body">
    <p>Especially beneficial for those involved in professions related to sand, agriculture, or soil, Bhomayag is considered highly advantageous for individuals such as farmers, civil engineers, architects, builders, developers, and brokers. The statue of the Earth Son (Shri Mangalgrah) and the Earth Mother is exclusively present at the Shri Mangalgrah Mandir in Amalner worldwide.
